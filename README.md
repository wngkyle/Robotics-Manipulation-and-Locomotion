# ROB2004 Robotics manipulation and locomotion

This repository provides material used for the class **ROB2004 Robotic manipulation and locomotion** taught at New York University by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti).
You are free to use and copy this material (at your own risk), please reference the material if you use it.

## Working with python
We work with Python 3.8 using numpy, scipy, matplotlib (come with Anaconda by default). Most the material will be given as Jupyter notebooks.

Anaconda is a straightforward, multi-platform, easy-to-use python distribution. It can be downloaded here https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and extensive documentation is available here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/

Jupyter (comes with default Anaconda installation) is a great way to create notebooks for python. A simple tutorial can be found here https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
